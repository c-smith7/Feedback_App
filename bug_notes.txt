Bugs:
- Paste plain text into 'Feedback Template' QTextEdit box: try to change Widget to a QPlainTextEdit?
- Output Feedback does not clear before generating a new output. Maybe think about clearing the student name
	field and the template field as well when the copy output button is pressed, or have a dedicated button to
	refresh the app. Or maybe just refresh and clear the template box, and not the student name so that you can
	remember who the previous student was you generted a feedback for.
