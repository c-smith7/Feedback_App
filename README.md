# VIPKid Auto Feedback Application
Usage
-----
1. Download app: [VIPKid Feedback App.exe](https://github.com/c-smith7/Feedback_GUI/raw/main/VIPKid%20Feedback%20App.exe)
2. More usage details about how to use the app will be updated ASAP. Before I do this I want to finish adding the automation feature first.

Feature Roadmap
------
These are not in order of importance. 
1. Separate widget window that stores the copied outputs, basically a built in clipboard. 
2. Add separate widget to allow editing of feedback signiture. "Edit Template" button that opens a 
	new widget window with current feedback displayed, and textedit to replace.
3. -OR- instead of student Radio button, have dropdown menu that allows you to select and add you own custom
	feedback signatures. 
4. Use Selenium to automate getting the feedback template from vipkid.com.
5. Add an installer window for .exe file.
